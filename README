This code demonstrates a rudimentary approach to interaction with actors.  A
line is cast from a (cone) pointer device through all actors. A OBB tree is
used to test intersection. This works fine for non-transformed actors. If
actors are transformed, the polydata represented in the actor's mapper needs
to be transformed before the intersection test is done. This is done though a
vtkTransformPolyDataFilter with the actor's matrix set as the transformation
matrix.

However, this method does not work for actors that are aggregated into a
vtkAssembly (like is done by vrml_read_as_assembly). The function
vrml_read_as_actor can be used instead, as it reads all objects in the VRML
file into one actor. The downside of that approach is that all colour
information in the VRML objects is lost (this functions appends the polydata
of all objects into one polydata object, but the colour information is in
the actor, not in the polydata).
